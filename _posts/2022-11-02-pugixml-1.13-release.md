---

pugixml-1.13 is out. This is a maintenance release that fixes several issues (read the [changelog](/docs/manual.html#v1.13) for details).

Highlights for this release include:

- xml_attribute::set_value, xml_node::set_value and xml_text::set now have overloads that accept pointer to non-null-terminated string and size
- Fix error handling in xml_document::save_file that could result in the function succeeding while running out of disk space
- Fix memory leak during error handling of some out-of-memory conditions during xml_document::load

You can [download the source package](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/releases/download/v1.13/pugixml-1.13.zip) or get the new version from GitHub using the latest tag (https://github.com/zeux/pugixml).
