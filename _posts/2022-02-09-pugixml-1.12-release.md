---

pugixml-1.12 is out. This is a maintenance release that fixes some compatibility issues and other minor bugs (read the [changelog](/docs/manual.html#v1.12) for details).

Highlights for this release include:

- Fix xml_document move construction (for C++11) and xml_node iterator signatures (for C++20)
- Add support for VS2022
- Reorganize CMake settings to have PUGIXML_ prefix and allow more configuration via CMake options, like choosing compact/wchar_t modes.

You can [download the source package](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/releases/download/v1.12/pugixml-1.12.zip) or get the new version from GitHub using the latest tag (https://github.com/zeux/pugixml).
